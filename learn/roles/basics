1. Role - defines permission at namespace level

2. ClusterRole - defines permission at cluster level

3. RoleBinding - Binds Role, clusterRole with the user, group, ServiceAccount

4. ClusterRoleBinding - Binds the Cluster Role with the user, group, ServiceAccount

5. Aggrecated Clusterroles - You can aggregate several ClusterRoles into one combined ClusterRole. A controller, running as part of the cluster control plane, watches for
ClusterRole objects with an aggregationRule set. The aggregationRule defines a label selector that the controller uses to match other ClusterRole objects that should be combined 
into the rules field of this one.
If you create a new ClusterRole that matches the label selector of an existing aggregated ClusterRole, that change triggers adding the new rules into the aggregated ClusterRole.
Here is an example that adds rules to the "monitoring" ClusterRole, by creating another ClusterRole labeled rbac.example.com/aggregate-to-monitoring: true.
